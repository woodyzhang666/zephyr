  CH57X Clock controller
  This node is in charge of system clock source selection and controlling
  clocks for periphrals.

  System clock source should be selected amongst the clock nodes available in
  "clocks" node (one of "clk_hse", "clk_pll", "clk_ck32k").
  Core clock frequency should also be defined, using "clock-frequency" property
  if the source is pll because a prescaler from pll or hse is supported.
